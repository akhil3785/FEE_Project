            <p>
                Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned theoretical physicist who revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental laws governing the universe. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein displayed a keen interest in science and mathematics from an early age. His groundbreaking contributions to physics, especially in the field of relativity, established him as one of the most influential scientists in history.

                    Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, to a middle-class Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was an engineer, while his mother, Pauline Einstein, was a talented pianist. Einstein also had one younger sister named Maja.

                    At the age of 15, Einstein went to the Swiss town of Aarau to complete his secondary education. There, he attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School and excelled in mathematics and physics. Einstein's remarkable mathematical abilities became evident during his time.

                    In 1900, Einstein graduated from the Polytechnic School with a diploma in mathematics and physics. He published four groundbreaking papers that addressed topics such as the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²).

                Theory of Relativity: 
            </h5>
            <p>
                In 1905, he introduced the special theory of relativity, which demonstrated that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other.

                Photoelectric Effect: 
            </h5>
            <p>
                Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, demonstrated that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons.

                Mass-Energy Equivalence: 
            </h5>
            <p>
                Through his equation E=mc², Einstein established the fundamental relationship between mass and energy. This concept demonstrated that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.
