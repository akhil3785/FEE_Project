                <p>
                    Isaac Newton was born in the manor house of Woolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire.
                     Although by the calendar in use at the time of his birth he was born on Christmas Day 1642,
                      we give the date of 4 January 1643 in this biography which is the "corrected" Gregorian 
                      calendar date bringing it into line with our present calendar.

                <p>
                    It would be easy to think that Newton's talent began to emerge on 
                    the arrival of Barrow to the Lucasian chair at Cambridge in 1663 when
                     he became a Fellow at Trinity College. Certainly the date matches the
                      beginnings of Newton's deep mathematical studies.

                    In 1703 he was elected president of the Royal Society and was
                     re-elected each year until his death. He was knighted in 1705 
                     by Queen Anne, the first scientist to be so honoured for his work.

                His mind was ablaze with original ideas. He made significant progress in three distinct fields – with some of the most profound discoveries in:

            <h5>
                Calculus
            </h5>
            <p>
                Sir Isaac Newton was the first individual to develop calculus.
                 Modern physics and physical chemistry are almost impossible without calculus,
                 as it is the mathematics of change.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Gravity
            </h5>
            <p>
                The famous apple that he saw falling from a tree led him to discover the force of gravitation and 
                its laws. Ultimately, he realised that the pressure causing the apple’s fall is responsible for 
                the moon to orbit the earth, as well as comets and other planets to revolve around the sun.

                        White light can be split into the colours of the rainbow! 
                        You’ll learn about this property in higher classes, known as 
                        the ‘splitting of white light’.This observation and inference were first given by Newton

                        Isaac Newton proposed the three laws of motion, famously known as Newton’s Law of Motion.
                         These laws revolutionised the motion of objects. Though these are considered simple
                          observations in the present day, these were complex ideas to be put in the form of 
                          laws back in the days.

                        light, Newton understood that the refractive telescope found by Galileo (another famous 
                        scientist around that time) had a few limitations. He applied his knowledge of optics to 
                        invent the reflective telescope.
