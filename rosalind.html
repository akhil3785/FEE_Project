            Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering British scientist who made significant contributions to the field of X-ray
            crystallography, which helped unravel the structure of DNA. Despite her groundbreaking work, she was not fully
            recognized for her achievements during her lifetime and was often overshadowed by her male colleagues. Franklin's work
            played a crucial role in the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, and her legacy continues to inspire
            generations of scientists.

                    Rosalind was born in London to a prominent Jewish family in 1920. Her father, E.C. Franklin, was a prominent banker, and
                    her mother, Mabel, was an active member of the women's suffrage movement.

                    X-ray crystallography is a technique used to investigate the structure of molecules. It involves exposing crystal
                    samples to X-ray beams and analyzing the resulting diffraction patterns.
